								<h3 class="subheading gray wow animated fadeInUp">George’s adoptive father and mother were an application engineer at GE and a high school physics teacher. They instilled in him a curiosity about how things work and a desire to fix them when they didn’t. His early training and experience was a blend of cognitive psychology, clinical psychology and computer science. This background has helped him anticipate not just the advances we have seen in information technology but their impact on the way we think and interact.</h3>
                                <p class="small muted-light wow animated fadeInUp">George’s first company, The Human Interface Group, became a pioneer in integrating process improvement and software to enhance team collaboration and performance. After selling the company to Lotus Development, George led the Lotus Institute and created software and services to support high-performance, distributed teamwork. He applied these approaches when serving on the post-merger integration team with Lotus and IBM.</p>
                                <p class="small muted-light wow animated fadeInUp">George then created TomorrowLab, which began to shift his interest in collaboration from internal teams to external customers and markets. At the same time he became a senior advisor to McKinsey &amp; Company. He eventually joined McKinsey as CEO of TomorrowLab@McKinsey. Subsequently, as a member of the Young Presidents Organisation and its International Board of Directors, George founded YPO Networks. He also served as lead independent director for Portal Software which was acquired by Oracle.</p>
                                <p class="small muted-light wow animated fadeInUp">In the last few years as Chairman and founder of Tapestry Networks, George has focused on healthcare. In particular how innovation and drug development can be improved at the same time as costs are reduced. He was instrumental in the creation of Tapestry’s European healthcare work where people with very different objectives have established trust and pioneered new models of collaboration in drug development.</p>
                                <p class="small muted-light wow animated fadeInUp">George and his wife, Ekaterina Malievskaia, MD, split their time between London and Boston.</p>
								<p class="quote">
									"I have spent my life working with teams of leaders seeking to do extraordinary things. The best of them fight the tendency to accept zero-sum strategies and declare victory. They understand that we can create environments where people suspend disbelief, build trust and chase unlikely combinations of new ideas and technologies."

                                <p class="small muted-light wow animated fadeInUp">After moving to London in 2011, Ekaterina worked in global health and medical philanthropy, focusing on improving outcomes in maternal and child health.
